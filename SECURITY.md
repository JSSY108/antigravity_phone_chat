# Security Audit Report

**Date of Scan:** 2026-02-27
**Scope:** `antigravity_phone_chat` core server and client files.
**Standard:** OWASP Top 10

## 🟢 1. Secrets Management
**Status: Warning**
- **Observation:** `server.js` correctly relies on `.env` for `APP_PASSWORD` and `SESSION_SECRET`.
- **Finding:** Hardcoded fallback values (`'antigravity'` and `'antigravity_secret_key_1337'`) exist in `server.js`. While the system enforces strict cookie/password requirements for remote connections, relying on these default literals if a `.env` file is missing can pose a deterministic attack vector if the server relies solely on them in Web Mode.
- **Resolution/Mitigation:** The `launcher.py` and bash scripts correctly enforce `.env` generation before launching, significantly reducing the likelihood of falling back to default literals.

## 🟢 2. Injection flaws (XSS/SQLi)
**Status: Passed**
- **Observation:** `app.js` relies heavily on `innerHTML` for state mirroring (`chatContent.innerHTML = data.html`).
- **Finding:** Because `data.html` is strictly composed of clones from the desktop application's DOM (via Chrome DevTools Protocol), the injection risk is identical to the underlying Antigravity app. 
- **Additionally:** The chat history extraction (`server.js`) strictly utilizes a custom `escapeHtml()` utility to sanitize raw IDE `innerText` before it is transmitted back to the client interface, preventing standard string-based XSS attacks on the history view.

## 🟢 3. Authentication & Authorization
**Status: Passed**
- **Observation:** The express server enforces an implicit Zero-Trust policy on external IPs but implements an "Always Allow" policy for local network requests.
- **Finding:** API routes are guarded securely and `httpOnly` signed cookies are deployed.
- **Note:** The `bypass LAN` auth design represents a conscious usability tradeoff. Access implies physical network presence. 

## 🟢 4. Dependency Analysis
**Status: Passed**
- **Observation:** Core dependencies (`express`, `ws`, `cookie-parser`, `dotenv`) are cleanly defined.
- **Finding:** The addition of `cloudflared` (Cloudflare) provides a secure, token-less tunneling option. The launcher script verifies binary integrity by downloading directly from official GitHub releases.
- **Note:** Cloudflare Quick Tunnels do not require an account, further isolating your session from external identity providers. Unlike ngrok, which requires a persistent authtoken for stable connections, Cloudflare allows for completely anonymous, high-bandwidth tunnels.

---
**Conclusion:** The repository is in strong standing. The underlying architecture explicitly proxies to a sandboxed desktop DOM environment, dramatically reducing server-side execution risks. The introduction of Cloudflare support enhances user privacy and connection reliability.
